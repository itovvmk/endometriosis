# Discurso y Dolor
This code was developed to extract word embeddings from a corpus of transcribed interviews in Spanish.
The interviews were part of the project Discurso y Dolor (Discourse and Pain). 
The word embeddings are generated with the Word2Vec tool from gensim. A personalized stop words list was created to properly clean the database.
